# Panu<3
Hyvää syntymäpäivää!
Hi!
This is a fun little project that I created to celebrate you! It was possible with a given amount of help from Copilot in Python using the Pygame library.

Installation
Make sure Python is installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Click the "snake_game.py file" and download the file.

Open your command window by writing "cmd" on your Start menu (on Windows) and press enter

Check if Python is installed correctly by running the command "python --version" 

Install the required dependencies with the following command in cmd: "pip install pygame"

To start the game, run the following command: "python panu5.py"

Use the arrow keys to move and space to jump and eat the cakes. After eating 3+1 cakes (I thought 31 pieces of cake would be too much even for you), a message will pop up!
